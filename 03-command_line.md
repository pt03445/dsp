# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

**Note:** Bash is not installed on a PC. Rather, PC users must install Cygwin. Once Cygwin has been installed, the command line interface witll _emulate_ bash. You can find all information regarding Cygwin [here](https://www.cygwin.com/).

### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > show current working directory path --> pwd    
    creating a directory --> mkdir <name of the dir>    
    deleting a directory --> rm -rf <name of the dir>
    creating a file using `touch` command --> touch <name of the file>
    deleting a file --> rm -rf <name of the file>
    renaming a file --> mv <originalNameFile> <NewFileName>
    listing hidden files --> ls -lart
    copying a file from one directory to another --> cp -r <sourcedirectory/filename> <destinationdirectory>

### Q4.  Xargs   

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

> > xargs Command in Unix takes the input from stdin and executes any given command over the input.
    eg: find . -name "*.c" | xargs rm -rf 
    In the example above, the command is to find any file name with extension ".C" and remove it. Xargs is taking the input (i.e) all   
    the files with .C extension and removes them.
